# SchoolEvents
Swift and School Event using DataModule for offline/online sync<br>
## Notes:
1-	School preset to Monash uni, Melbourne. Geolocation is school.lat = -37.896751; school.lon = 145.147141. Not yet adding screen for School. Uncertain the purpose.<br>
2-	Uncertain about payment â€“ it is not yet done. Usually it should be done by admin side? Or participant can choose to pay byself? Then we need server for that purpose.<br>
3-	Location, is using suburb, from json.<br>
4-	Distance is calc using Mapkit, not api, for point to point with lat/lon.<br>
5-	The app is offline with SQLlite. It can sync to a server when we know the API. The idea is user can use it even offline. <br>
6-	There must be login screen for user roles: organiser, and participant to access certain screens as read only or full control respectively.<br>
